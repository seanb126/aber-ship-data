# aber-ship-data

Originally built for a university project.

## Additional Information

The project was developed within a short time-frame, and as such it isn't very efficient and requires extensive refactoring. Fortunately the code worked and passed with high marks.

## License
This code is not released under an open-source license and therefore default copyright laws apply. I have made the code public here to showcase to potential employers.
Thank you :)
